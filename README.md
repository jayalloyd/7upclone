7UP Website Clone
Project Overview
This project is a front-end clone of a section of the official 7UP website, built to demonstrate skills in modern web development using fundamental HTML and CSS. The goal was to replicate the visual design, layout, and responsiveness of the original site's hero sections and fixed navigation bar.

Live Demo:  jayalloyd.github.io/7upclone/

Features

•	Fixed Navigation Bar: A sticky header that remains visible at the top of the page, featuring the brand logo, navigation links, and social media icons.

•	Responsive Layout: The design adapts to various screen sizes, from large desktops to mobile devices, using CSS media queries.

•	Dynamic Hero Sections: Three distinct hero sections with different background images and overlaid content, showcasing product information, recipes, and a store locator.

•	CSS Best Practices: Utilizes modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox for layout, box-sizing: border-box for consistent element sizing, and CSS Custom Properties (variables) for improved maintainability.

Technologies Used

•	HTML5: For structuring the webpage content.

•	CSS3: For styling and layout, including:

o	Flexbox

o	Positioning (fixed, absolute, relative)

o	CSS Custom Properties (for future improvements)

o	Media Queries for responsiveness
